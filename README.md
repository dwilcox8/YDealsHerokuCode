# YDealsHerokuCode

A simple PHP app on the Heroku web server that polls the YDeals feeds for any new deals. If there is a new deal, then I fire off a notification to devices using my YDeals app. 

Android App - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.travel.jojo.yvrdeals 

iPhone App - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.travel.jojo.yvrdeals 

I started with the Heroku base app - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php and then built upon it to include Google Firestore for notifications.
